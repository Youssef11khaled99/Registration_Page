# Registration_Page

First you need to install Appserv from this link https://www.appserv.org/en/howto/

Then you should create a database in phpMyAdmin with name 'accounts', then create a table with name 'users' 

Then put the project folders in this path ( C:\AppServ\www\'Task - name')

Then write in your browser (" http://localhost/'Task - name'/register.php ")

And that's it :)
