# Registration_Page

First you need to install Appserv from this link: https://www.appserv.org/en/howto/

Then you should create a database in phpMyAdmin with name 'accounts', then create a table with name 'users' 
using this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQjyBDF2MF4

Then put the project files in a folder in this path ( C:\AppServ\www\yourTaskFolderName) Note: you can name task folder any name
but you should put the same name in the below link.

Then write in your browser (" http://localhost/yourTaskFolderName/register.php ")

And that's it :)
